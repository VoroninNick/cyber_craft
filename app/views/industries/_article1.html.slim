        |New challenges for independent software vendors and technology companies
      p
        |The high-paced, ever-changing and highly competitive business world of today constantly challenges Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and technology companies to deliver new features and products. Software development must address new business opportunities, meet changing market needs and growing customer expectations. Satisfying these demands requires high adaptability and flexible strategies; custom software development is the only option that can fulfill these needs. Increasingly, companies seek innovative and cost-effective software provider solutions through nearshore and offshore outsourcing to obtain quicker time-to-market product releases while ensuring quality, reliability, high performance and security for their confidential information.

        |The current trend in software development is a cloud based multi-sourced approach that integrates in-house IT departments with offshore software development to provide custom software solutions. This allows increased flexibility and cost savings over the traditional tower-based outsourcing approach. Over $100 billion of outsourcing contracts will be renegotiated in the next year, and businesses must take advantage of technology to fulfill their IT needs while containing costs.
